# Zomato_PowerBI
This was the final project I completed as a part of my BIA training with TripleTen. It analyzed Zomato (food delivery platform) data. 
## What I Worked On

The BI team usually looks at three main areas:

- **Customers:** Who uses Zomato? How do they behave?  
- **Restaurants:** Which ones are popular? Which make the most money?  
- **Sales:** How do sales change over time? What are the key numbers?  

I picked **[your focus area, e.g. Customers]** to dive deeper into. I made a dashboard and report to share what I found.
